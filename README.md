# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

### Project Description:
- The aim of this project is to find out whether a particular credit card transaction is a fraud or not. These kinds of projects help us to find out the probability of the customers having a fraudulent transaction.
- The dataset keeps the privacy of a customer enrolled in their bank. The transaction details have been converted into some scaled reduced features to keep the integrity of the relationship between the client and the bank.
- The dataset includes the following features: ['Time', 'V1', 'V2', 'V3', 'V4', 'V5', 'V6', 'V7', 'V8', 'V9', 'V10', 'V11', 'V12', 'V13', 'V14', 'V15', 'V16', 'V17', 'V18', 'V19', 'V20', 'V21', 'V22', 'V23', 'V24', 'V25', 'V26', 'V27', 'V28', 'Amount', 'Class'].
- All the given features are continuous.
